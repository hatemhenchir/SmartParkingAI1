# Smart Parking AI

Smart Parking AI is a project that uses deep learning learning and computer vision to automate the entry process at parking facilities. The system detects the license plate of a car using object detection and reads it with OCR to check if the car is registered and paid for.

## Submodules

Smart Parking AI consists of two submodules:

- `ParkApp`: This submodule contains the mobile app used to display parking availability and their positions to drivers.
- `smart-parking-deep-learning`: This submodule contains the deep learning models used to detect license plates and read them with OCR.

## Getting started

To get started with Smart Parking AI, you'll need:

- A set of cameras or other imaging devices to capture images of cars entering the parking facility
- A server or cloud-based platform to run the machine learning algorithms
- A database of registered and paid cars
- The `ParkApp` submodule, which can be found at [https://github.com/hatemhenchir/ParkApp](https://github.com/hatemhenchir/ParkApp).
- The `smart-parking-deep-learning` submodule, which can be found at [https://github.com/hatemhenchir/smart-parking-deep-learning](https://github.com/hatemhenchir/smart-parking-deep-learning).
